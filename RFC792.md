## Introduction

The Internet Protocol (IP) [1] is used for host-to-host datagram
service in a system of interconnected networks called the
Catenet [2].  The network connecting devices are called Gateways.
These gateways communicate between themselves for control purposes
via a Gateway to Gateway Protocol (GGP) [3,4].  Occasionally a
gateway or destination host will communicate with a source host, for
example, to report an error in datagram processing.  For such
purposes this protocol, the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP),
is used.  ICMP, uses the basic support of IP as if it were a higher
level protocol, however, ICMP is actually an integral part of IP, and
must be implemented by every IP module.

ICMP messages are sent in several situations:  for example, when a
datagram cannot reach its destination, when the gateway does not have
the buffering capacity to forward a datagram, and when the gateway
can direct the host to send traffic on a shorter route.

The Internet Protocol is not designed to be absolutely reliable.  The
purpose of these control messages is to provide feedback about
problems in the communication environment, not to make IP reliable.
There are still no guarantees that a datagram will be delivered or a
control message will be returned.  Some datagrams may still be
undelivered without any report of their loss.  The higher level
protocols that use IP must implement their own reliability procedures
if reliable communication is required.

The ICMP messages typically report errors in the processing of
datagrams.  To avoid the infinite regress of messages about messages
etc., no ICMP messages are sent about ICMP messages.  Also ICMP
messages are only sent about errors in handling fragment zero of
fragemented datagrams.  (Fragment zero has the fragment offeset equal
zero).

## Message Formats

ICMP messages are sent using the basic IP header.  The first octet of
the data portion of the datagram is a ICMP type field; the value of
this field determines the format of the remaining data.  Any field
labeled "unused" is reserved for later extensions and must be zero
when sent, but receivers should not use these fields (except to
include them in the checksum).  Unless otherwise noted under the
individual format descriptions, the values of the internet header
fields are as follows:

### Version

`4`

### IHL

`Internet header length in 32-bit words.`

### Type of Service

`0`

### Total Length

`Length of internet header and data in octets.`

### Identification, Flags, Fragment Offset

`Used in fragmentation, see [1].`

### Time to Live

`Time to live in seconds; as this field is decremented at each
machine in which the datagram is processed, the value in this
field should be at least as great as the number of gateways which
this datagram will traverse.`

### Protocol

`ICMP = 1`

### Header Checksum

`The 16 bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of all 16
bit words in the header.  For computing the checksum, the checksum
field should be zero.  This checksum may be replaced in the
future.`

### Source Address

`The address of the gateway or host that composes the ICMP message.
Unless otherwise noted, this can be any of a gateway's addresses.`

### Destination Address

`The address of the gateway or host to which the message should be
sent.`

IP Fields:

### Addresses

`The address of the source in an echo message will be the
destination of the echo reply message.  To form an echo reply
message, the source and destination addresses are simply reversed,
the type code changed to 0, and the checksum recomputed.`

### Type

`8 for echo message;`

`0 for echo reply message.`

### Code

`0`

### Checksum

`The checksum is the 16-bit ones's complement of the one's
complement sum of the ICMP message starting with the ICMP Type.
For computing the checksum , the checksum field should be zero.
If the total length is odd, the received data is padded with one
octet of zeros for computing the checksum.  This checksum may be
replaced in the future.`

### Identifier

`If code = 0, an identifier to aid in matching echos and replies,
may be zero.`

### Sequence Number

`If code = 0, a sequence number to aid in matching echos and
replies, may be zero.`

### Description

`The data received in the echo message must be returned in the echo
reply message.`

`The identifier and sequence number may be used by the echo sender
to aid in matching the replies with the echo requests.  For
example, the identifier might be used like a port in TCP or UDP to
identify a session, and the sequence number might be incremented
on each echo request sent.  The echoer returns these same values
in the echo reply.`

`Code 0 may be received from a gateway or a host.`
